# Prediction-of-Heart-Attack-Using-3-Data-Mining-Techniques-as-Hybrid-Classification
Mining of a Kaggle dataset of patients
Heart attack prediction is treated as one of the most complicated tasks in the field of medical sciences. Thus, there arises a need to develop a decision support system for detecting chances of heart attack of a patient. This is basically an android application on front end and backend is based on data mining techniques in python coding that tells whether in future the person has the chance of heart attack or not? This application generates results on the spot, immediately after getting the data and also the results are more accurate as compare to the previous applications developed for this purpose
Application was tested using dataset of 70,000 persons. The output was compared with previous applicationsâ€™ results (Kardia and Modification (Astro-CHARM) calculator). This system generated accuracy of 80%,80%,68% for the three techniques of prediction with a combined total of 80% where as previous applications worked on only one technique with highest accuracy around 70%.
